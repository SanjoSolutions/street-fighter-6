# Street Fighter 6

## Strategy

### HP dynamic

When one is in the HP lead (ones character has more HP than the character of the other player),
one can potentially sit back and play very safe, because one wins the turn on time over.

When ones character has less HP than the character of the other player, then
it makes more sense to do actions which are only safe to some degree because
on time over one loses the round with the current HPs, so trying something
that potentially leads to an HP lead, makes sense.
